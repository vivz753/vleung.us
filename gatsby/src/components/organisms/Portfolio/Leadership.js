					<P>
						When overwhelmed with school work, I found solace in community service clubs. Working with Society of Women Engineers at San Jose State University allowed me to build rapport with like-minded individuals. Together, we cultivated a safe place for women in engineering, empowering them to pursue their full potential in engineering and leadership at SJSU. How? By partnering with local and wordly organizations, facilitating panels with alumni and professionals, fundraising for national conventions, and electing thirty chair positions to our board to assist with end-of-the-year goalsâ€”we had many!
